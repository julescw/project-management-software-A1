# Project Management Software - Assignment 1
This is a Project Management Software coding assignment from the course SYSC2006 - Foundations of Imperative Programming.

The purpose of the Project Management Software is to allow the user to track the progress of their project. In the project structure, the user can add up to 5 project milestones, which can each contain up to 3 activities. Every activity must be assigned a unique ID, name, and estimated time and cost. They also have a completion status, prompting the user to input the actual time and cost when completed. These attributes allow the program to 

After the initialization stage where the user inputs information about the project, a main menu continuously prints where they have the options to print the project information and update the activities, thus updating the milestones and the project.

The assignment came with unchangeable data structures and preset function headers. I have added several functions to improve the program's functionality, and these changes are noted in the file a1_functions.h.

This assignment helped me familiarize myself with control statements and loops, header and source files, pre-processor directives, as well as applying what I'd learned about arrays, structures and pointers. It was also my first time working with user input in C.
